## Student Resources

Welcome to this course! We're so glad you're here. In this repo, you'll find all of the materials, slides, and resources necessary to succeed in the course.

This 4-hour course is an introduction to JavaScript for software developers. The course gives developers the fundamentals they need to take the next steps with JavaScript frameworks and libraries. There‚Äôs often a temptation to skip the fundamentals and to jump right into advanced concepts. This course will provide a foundation in four hours and equip engineers with what they need to make a positive impact on JavaScript projects.

## Course Times ‚è±

Timing is one the most important features of a successful class. Sometimes you will be able to cover a lot of ground. Sometimes you'll only be able to cover required topics. Every class is different. It's most important to honor the scheduled breaks and end times - move on when it's time to move on!

The following is a schedule for online and in-person deliveries:
